	Game explanation:

	Each of the two players has 8 Meeples.
	
		1) Player 1 starts and can select a meeple for player2.
		2) Player 2 has to place this meeple on a free field on the board.
		3) Player 2 chooses a meeple for the first player.
		4) Player 1 sets that meeple to a free field.
	
	This has to be repeated until one player wins or every meeple has been set which would 	be a tie.

		* Color:	 Black  | White
